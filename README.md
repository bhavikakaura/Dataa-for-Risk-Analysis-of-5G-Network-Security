Risk Analysis of 5G Network Security
Project Overview
The risk analysis of 5G network security is essential in identifying potential threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts to ensure that the network is resilient against cyberattacks. This project delves into the various risk factors that could affect the 5G infrastructure, such as data breaches, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and unauthorized access. Our goal is to prioritize these risks and develop effective mitigation strategies to enhance the security of 5G networks.

Methodologies for Calculating Risk
In this project, we employ several methodologies to assess and quantify the risks associated with 5G network security:

1. Fault Tree Analysis (FTA)
Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) is a top-down approach used to analyze the potential causes of a system failure. It helps identify critical vulnerabilities in the system and assess their impacts on the network's security.

2. Event Tree Analysis (ETA)
Event Tree Analysis (ETA) is used to evaluate the possible outcomes of an event and their consequences. It helps in understanding how different security events evolve over time and affect the 5G network.

3. Poisson Distribution
The Poisson Distribution is applied to model the probability of occurrence of rare security events, such as system failures or cyberattacks, over a fixed period. This method helps quantify the likelihood of specific security threats.

4. Bayesian Analysis
Bayesian Analysis is used to calculate the probability of certain events or outcomes by incorporating prior knowledge. This approach allows us to continuously update our risk assessment as new information or data becomes available.

5. F-N Curve Influence Table
The F-N Curve Influence Table helps in evaluating the severity and frequency of security incidents. It provides a graphical representation of the relationship between failure events and their likelihood, aiding in risk prioritization.

6. Decision Theory
Decision Theory helps in making informed decisions by evaluating the potential outcomes of different security strategies. This methodology allows for optimizing risk mitigation actions, ensuring the most efficient and effective security measures are applied.
